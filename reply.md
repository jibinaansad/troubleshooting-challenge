Subject: Assistance with DNS Configuration for site.recruitment.shq.nz

Hi Alice,

Thanks for reaching out regarding the issue with accessing your website, site.recruitment.shq.nz.

Upon investigation, I found that the DNS configuration for your domain is pointing to a private IP address, 192.168.1.10, which is not accessible from the internet. This is likely causing the connection error you're experiencing.

To resolve this, you'll need to update the DNS records to point to the correct public IP address. Here’s how you can do that:

Steps to Resolve:

Log in to your SiteHost control panel at SiteHost Control Panel.
Go to the DNS management section.
Locate the A record for site.recruitment.shq.nz.
Update the A record to point to the public IP address: 120.138.30.179.
Please note, it may take up to 24-48 hours for the DNS changes to fully propagate and for the site to become accessible again.

If you encounter any issues during the process or need further assistance, don’t hesitate to reach out.

Best regards,
Jibina
